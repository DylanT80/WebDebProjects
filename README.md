#### DevLog ####
Date  | Notes
------------- | -------------
9/6  | Finished tutorial, added a clear all button
9/7 | Added profiles. Hardest part was remembering/realizing that localStorage.setItem()'s' arguments get converted to string. Also, use setAttribute instead of addEventListener to have onclick attr stored in innerHTML. MVP done, just need some styling and then a localStorage.clear() button!
